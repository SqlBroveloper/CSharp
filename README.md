# NOOB-COMPLETE
A repository of C# scripts created when I was a complete noob.

I want to try weird things in C# that most people don't use it for.  This repository will contain some code that demonstrates what stage of the learning process I am in.  I have some fairly ambitious plans, so we'll see what kind of wonkey code I end up with!  Feel free to make copies and changes yourself, read it, ask me questions, and just have fun messing around in C#.
